## Overview

With working from home becoming the new normal and more companies encouraging remote hires, it is easy to feel disconnected from not knowing your fellow colleagues on a more personal level. Our daily interactions become more work-driven and we no longer have the luxury of casual chit-chats happening spontaneously in a shared physical workplace.

Fika aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for such one-to-one conversations with random colleagues, even those beyond your department or functional group, as a first step to building lasting connections.

> Fika is the Swedish word for coffee and cake break. But it is more than just that. It is a concept and a state of mind, and an important part of Swedish culture.
>
> It means making time for friends and colleagues to share a cup of coffee (or tea) and a little something to eat. To take a pause in life and socialise. To relax the mind and strengthen relationships.


Fika was built over 3 days for the [CODE_EXP Hackathon 2021](https://codeexp.tk.sg/), which is part of [BrainHack 2021](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/brainhack).
